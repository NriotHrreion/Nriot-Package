## Helps

Help list
```cmd
nriot help
```

You can start a Localhost server with the following command.
```cmd
nriot server <port>
```

You can also use some small functions, like "**Query Date**" or "Query Weather"...
```cmd
nriot query [function]
```
But if you are using Query Weather, you need to add the Chinese city name you want to query in Chinese after the function.
like this:
```cmd
# Shanghai
nriot query weather 上海
```
